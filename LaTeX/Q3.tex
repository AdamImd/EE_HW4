\section{Text to image Generation}

\subsection{(A)No Prompt}
% (a) [2 pts] Run your pipeline using ωCFG = 0.0, η = 0.0 and 50 sampling steps without
% any positive or negative prompt to make sure everything works (this should give you
% a meaningful image generated unconditionally).



\subsection{(B-C) 5X3 prompts- Manual evaluation}

% (b) [6 pts] Create 15 engaging prompts based on 5 unique and different topics (see some
% examples in (b) figure). For each topic, write three versions of the same idea:
% 1. Simple and short: a short, clear prompt (about one sentence).
% 2. Medium: a slightly longer prompt that adds some detail or context.
% 3. Long and complex: a detailed, imaginative version that expands on the idea
% with creative or descriptive elements.

% 6You will end up with 5 topics × 3 versions = 15 prompts in total. Do not rely on
% LLMs to generate you these prompts and use your creativity to generate interesting
% prompts that you want to see visualized as images. For each prompt, generate the
% corresponding SD output. Use ωCFG = 10.0 with 50 sampling steps and η = 0.0. Keep
% the negative prompt NULL. Finally, assign each generated image a similarity score (out
% of 10) based on how well it matches the intended prompt (e.g., 5.4/10.0). Share your
% thoughts. For instance, which version of a prompt typically gave the best similarity
% or image quality? Does prompt length affect fidelity to the intended concept or the
% final image quality?
I implemented a pipeline that will read from a set of prompts, and then use them to generate the images from the diffusers StableDiffusionPipeline module, with the $\omega CFG = 10$, num steps = 50, $eta = 0.0$, and a fixed seed at 42. The prompts for each image are included in the caption of the figures. The results for the five categories that I chose are:

% (c) [8 pts] Implement CLIP-based similarity scoring (Radford et al., 2021) to automat-
% ically evaluate how well each generated image aligns with its corresponding prompt.
% Conceptually, CLIP computes embeddings for both the image and the text prompt in
% a shared feature space, and the similarity between them is measured using the cosine
% of the angle between their embeddings.
% Similar to SD, you can find different pre-trained CLIP models (and their corresponding
% model cards with implementation details) in Hugging Face . Compare the CLIP
% similarity scores with your own manually assigned similarity ratings from the previous
% step. Discuss any trends, differences, or insights you observe and reflect on how well
% you believe this metric aligns with human judgment.


\subsection{(D) Negative Prompts}
% (d) [4 pts] Now select one of these 15 prompts and come up with a meaningful negative
% prompt to feed to SD. Fix number of steps to 50 and η = 0.0 but select ωCFG ∈
% {0.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, 12.0, 15.0}. Report the generated images and their corresponding
% CLIP similarity scores. Comment on them.

I chose the prompt: "An astronaut in a spacesuit floating above Earth"
